## 📒 Key Learnings

### 📌 SoC Fundamentals
- An **SoC combines CPU, memory, peripherals, and communication buses** on a single chip.
- Integrates digital logic, clocking, IO interfaces, and control logic.

### 📌 BabySoC Overview
- A simplified SoC model used for **educational and pre-silicon design practice**.
- Helps understand the hierarchy and dataflow between CPU, memory, and peripherals.

### 📌 Functional Modeling
- Performed *before* RTL/Physical Design to **validate logic and connectivity**.
- Simulations help catch integration issues early using testbenches.

### 📌 Simulation Workflow
- ✅ `iverilog` used to compile Verilog + testbench  
- ✅ `vvp` to run simulation  
- ✅ `GTKWave` to analyze `.vcd` waveform output  

Captured and observed:
- ✅ Clock operation  
- ✅ Reset functionality  
- ✅ Module signal interactions  
- ✅ Internal data flow behavior
