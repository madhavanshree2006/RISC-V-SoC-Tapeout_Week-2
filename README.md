<summary><h2> What is a System on a Chip (SoC)?</h2> </summary>


<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/1.png" width="700" alt="image 1"/></p>

A **System on a Chip (SoC)** is like fitting an entire computer onto a single microchip. Instead of using many separate components like CPU, memory, input/output controllers, graphics, and connectivity chips, an SoC packs most (or all) of them into one compact silicon chip. This makes devices smaller, faster, and more power efficient—perfect for smartphones, wearables, smart appliances, and even cars.

---

## **Main Components Inside an SoC (with explanations)**

## 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)🧠

<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/2.png" width="700" alt="image 2"/></p>

The CPU is the **main decision-maker** inside an SoC. Think of it as the *manager* that handles all general tasks. Here's what it does:

- Executes instructions from the operating system and apps.
- Performs arithmetic, logic, and control operations.
- Manages scheduling, multitasking, and system coordination.
- Often comes as multi-core (e.g., quad-core, octa-core) to handle multiple tasks at once.

---

## 2. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/3.jpeg" width="700" alt="image 3"/></p>

The GPU is designed for **heavy visual and parallel processing tasks**. It’s like the *artist + accelerator* of the chip.

- Renders UI, videos, animations, and games.
- Handles 2D and 3D graphics efficiently.

# Cnverstion of TL-Verilog -> Verilog

❗ At the beginning, you’ll only find the rvmyth.tlv file inside the src/module/ directory, because the RVMYTH core is implemented in TL-Verilog. To run simulations, this needs to be transformed into a .v file. 
Follow the steps below to perform the TL-Verilog to Verilog conversion:


**Step 1 – Set up Python environment tools**

Make sure you have `python3-venv` installed. If not, update your package list and install it along with `pip`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

```

**Step 2 – Build and activate a virtual environment**

Navigate into your project directory and create a Python virtual environment called `sp_env`. Then activate it:

```bash
cd VSDBabySoC/
python3 -m venv sp_env
source sp_env/bin/activate

```

**Step 3 – Add SandPiper-SaaS**

Within the virtual environment, install the necessary Python packages including SandPiper-SaaS:

```bash
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas

```
<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/25.png" width="700" alt="image 25"/></p>

**Step 4 – Perform TL-Verilog to Verilog conversion**

Finally, run SandPiper to translate the TLV file (`rvmyth.tlv`) into a Verilog file (`rvmyth.v`):

```bash
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/

```

<summary><h2> 1️⃣ Pre-Synthesis Simulation</h2></summary>

### 🛠️ RTL Compilation with Icarus Verilog

- 🔸 **Macro Used:** `DPRE_SYNTH_SIM`
- 🔸**Why:** To check the RTL design behavior before moving to synthesis.
- 🔸**Result:** An executable simulation file (`pre_synth_sim.out`) along with a `.vcd` waveform file inside `output/pre_synth_sim/`.

❗Before going to the simulation part, ensure that your project diectory like this

```
VSDBabySoC
├── images
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── output
│   ├── pre_synth_sim
├── README.md
├── sp_env
├── src

```
- If not like this create the folder accordingly.

👉 Use the following command to launch the pre-synthesis simulation:

```bash
iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out   -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM   -I src/include   -I src/module   src/module/testbench.v

cd output/pre_synth_sim

ls

```

<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/27.png" width="700" alt="image 27"/></p>
<br><br>

👉 Then to produce ```.vcd``` file and to see the waveform in ```Gtkwave``` follow the commands
```
./pre_synth_sim.out

gtkwave pre_synth_sim.vcd

```

<p align="center"><img src="./ASSETS/28.png" width="700" alt="image 28"/></p>
---

## **Measured observations**

### **1) Reset — behavior & effect** 

**Measured:** **reset asserted at 20 ns and deasserted at 120 ns (80 ns pulse).**

**Observed:** while reset is high, instruction fetch is disabled and register file entries are set to known index values (SandPiper reset behavior). After reset deassertion, fetch resumes and **PC** increments by 4.

**report:**

> “Reset asserted from 20 ns to 120 ns. Fetch disabled and register file initialized during reset; normal execution resumes after release.” 🔍
> 

---

### **2) Clock — generation & period** 

**Expected (RTL):** `avsdpll.v` initial period = **25 ns → 40 MHz**.

**Measured:** using two GTKWave cursors on consecutive rising edges → **≈ 25 ns (40 MHz)**.

**Implication:** core registers and pipeline stages are clocked as intended.

**report:**

> “Measured clock period ≈ 25 ns → 40 MHz (two cursors on successive CLK rising edges).”
> 

---

### **3) Data path: CPU → DAC → OUT (numeric check)** 

**DAC transfer (from `avsddac.v`):**

```verilog
OUT = VREFL + (Dext / 1023.0) * (VREFH - VREFL)
where Dext = {1'b0, D}

```

**Observed sample:** **RV_TO_DAC = 225 → OUT ≈ 0.72 V** in waveform.

**Calculated:** **(225 / 1023) * 3.3 ≈ 0.726 V** (testbench uses `VREFH = 3.3`, `VREFL = 0.0`).

**Conclusion:** observed analog **OUT** matches predicted value — the CPU → DAC mapping is correct.

**report:**

> “RV_TO_DAC = 225 → OUT ≈ 0.72 V; matches expected OUT ≈ 0.726 V per DAC formula.”
> 

---

## **GTKWave: steps to analyze waveform**

1. `gtkwave pre_synth_sim.vcd`
2. Add signals: `uut` → `core` → **`RV_TO_DAC[9:0]`**, **`OUT`**, **`CLK`**, **`reset`**, and desired **`CPU_*`** internals.
3. Set bus radix to decimal: right-click **`RV_TO_DAC`** → **Radix** → **Unsigned (decimal)**.
4. Measure clock: zoom on **`CLK`**, place cursor A on a rising edge and cursor B on the next rising edge; read **ΔT** (status bar).
5. Measure reset window: place cursor on reset rising and cursor on reset falling; read **ΔT**.
6. Verify DAC mapping: hover **`RV_TO_DAC`** (decimal) and **`OUT`** at the same time and compare with **(code/1023)*VREFH**.

---

**The pre-synthesis run confirms correct reset behavior, a stable 40 MHz PLL clock, and accurate CPU→DAC mapping (digital codes produce expected analog voltages).**

    ✔ `opt_clean`, `hierarchy`, `flatten`, `check`
    
- Observed:
    - 5157 total cells
    - rvmyth auto-expanded memories to registers
- Generated:
    
    ✅ `vsdbabysoc_synth_net.v`

### **📌** Post-Synthesis Simulation

- Compiled with:
    
    ```
    iverilog -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM ...
    
    ```
    
- Testbench updated to include synthesized netlist
- Simulated `.out` using `vvp`
- Generated:
    
    ✅ `post_synth_sim.vcd`

### **📌** Debugging VCD & Netlist View

- GTKWave error:
    
    ❌ “Unknown VCD identifier”
    
    ➝ Result of malformed `$dumpvars` or missing timescale/signals
    
- Fixed by:
    
    ✅ Re-exporting VCD with correct dump commands
    
- Tried visualizing netlist using `yosys show`
    
    ➝ Needed selecting only the **top module**

## 🛠️ Tools in Action

✔ Yosys → Full SoC synthesis

✔ Icarus Verilog → RTL & netlist simulation

✔ GTKWave → VCD waveform debug

✔ Sky130 libs → Standard cell mapping

✔ Graphviz (Yosys show) → Netlist structure

> 💡 “Week 2 pushed synthesis to the SoC level — from isolated RTL to a full hierarchical build with peripherals, includes, libraries, and netlists. Faced errors, fixed them, and learned the *real* debug workflow beyond just coding!” 🚀
